# Filepicker

Filepicker widget is used to allow users to upload files from their local machines to any cloud storage via API. Cloudinary and Amazon S3 have simple APIs for cloud storage uploads

## Upload File

You can upload files by creating a post API and referring to the base64 or binary version of the file in the post body. The data format is determined by the Data Type property in the property pane

```
{{ Filepicker1.files[0].data }}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
When you try to log the data, it appears in the blob format. But, if the user uses it in an API/query, itâ€™ll actually upload base64/binary data.

See our guides on

* [Uploading a File to S3](../../learning-and-resources/how-to-guides/how-to-upload-to-s3.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
if you are trying to upload large files, please increase the timeout in API configuration. Whenever the file is larger than 5mb it is stored as blob.
