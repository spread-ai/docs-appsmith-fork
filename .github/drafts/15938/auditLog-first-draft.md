**Intro**

The audit log is the report of all the activities done in Appsmith. It will automatically capture and display events by recording who performed an activity, what when, and where it was performed.

The main log of events for audits and compliance that weâ€™ll provide is around



* **Application-specific activities** - when was a change made to a page, who configured a new datasource, who ran a query and when or who deleted an existing app
* **Administrative configuration changes** - who changed an admin email, when was a new group added or role modified
* **User sign-up and login activity** - when a new user signed up, when was an attempted login unsuccessful and so on

**Filtering audit logs **



1. Users - To get a trace of activities performed by a user, filter by their email address.
2. Event names - Filter events by their name, for example for logs for query executions can be accessed by filtering by the query.executed event 
3. Resource ID - A resourceID identifies each entity on your Appsmith instance be it a workspace, application, page, datasource, query or JSObject.
