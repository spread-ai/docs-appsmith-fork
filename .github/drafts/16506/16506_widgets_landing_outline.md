## Common Properties

The following properties are common across many of Appsmith's widgets. You can find them by selecting your widget and checking its properties pane, and use them to customize the details and behavior of your app.

| **Property** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Animate Loading** | When turned off, the widget will load without any skeletal animation. You can use a toggle switch to turn it on/off. |
| **Disabled** | Makes the widget un-clickable or unusable. The widget will remain visible to the user but user interaction will not be allowed. |
| **Error Message** | Sets the text of the error message to display if user input is considered invalid. | 
| **Tooltip** | Sets a tooltip for the widget. You can add hints or extra information about the required input from the user. |
| **Placeholder** | Sets the placeholder text within the input box. Use to show a hint or example value to the user. |
| **Regex** | Used to add custom regex validation to perform on user input. When the input does not match the regex expression, the input is considered invalid. |
| **Required** | Sets whether the input field is a mandatory field. When the input widget is within a Form widget, that Form's submit button will be automatically disabled until a user adds input to the field. |
| **Valid** | Sets an expression to decide whether the user's input is considered valid. When the expression evaluates to `false`, the input is considered invalid and the widget will show its **Error Message**. |
| **Visible** | Controls widget's visibility on the page. When turned off: The widget will not be visible when the app is published. It appears translucent when in Edit mode. |
