# Outline
 Introduction

**_   Elaborate on the below points (2 or 3 small paragraphs)_**

What's self-hosting, and why is it important? 

	A self-hosted service is one provided by the owner directly rather than relying on a third-party service provider. This can be done for many different services but is most commonly seen with web hosting, file hosting, and email hosting. Self-hosting is often seen as a more secure and private alternative to using third-party services, as the user has full control over their data and how it is used. (elaborate on this with an example using Appsmith)

## Appsmith cloud and self-hosted versions

Appsmith provides a platform for developing internal apps. It provides a [cloud version](app.appsmith.com] and the option to set up your own Appsmith instance. 


# Install

Why self-host Appsmith?



* You get to keep your data on-premise. 
* Your apps and your API keys would never leave your server. By self-hosting, users retain control. 
* The applications you build would be on your infrastructure, inside your corporate networks, and you would have access to your internal databases. 
* Using cloud Appsmith would require the ability to access the internal databases from the Appsmith cloud. Otherwise, you couldn't build apps that used internal databases.
* You can configure more flexible updates, update schedules, and other maintenance for multiple Appsmith instances and versions.


## Pre-setup checklist

	Weâ€™ll talk about the minimum system requirement and recommended setup for Appsmith.
